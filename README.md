# Blackjack in JavaScript
###### Based on Pluralsight Javascript: Getting Started Tutorial

## Github Pages

## Description
This site replicates the popular card game Blackjack, and was created following the tutorial in Pluralsight Javascript: Getting Started.
I was able to sharpen up on JavaScript skills and additional features by myself, such as being able to see the visible cards with the correct suit colour rather than just using text. The game also ends whenever a player is dealt 21 exactly.

## To-do
- Make the site responsive
- Add additional rules: The dealer wins with 5 cards, catch ties
- Make the message upon game over look more impactful
